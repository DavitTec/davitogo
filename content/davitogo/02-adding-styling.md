## Look and Feel

### Adding style sheet and structure a website

While we are trying to develop a cool Hugo static website and starting to build a new theme, *davitogo*, one of the stumbling blocks to make the site look good is the start from a ready made theme, however, adopting another theme and configure content to suit it will probably introduce some features that are messy or overly complicated.  The building blocks of a good design and structure is not about the tools but more about the plan. Therefore, having a clear roadmap to design and structure should lay the foundation as to how the look and feel ends up. But there are some aspects to project definition that will always introduce boundaries and restrictions.  A good design and structure of a website is limited only by the initial plan and project definition. However, the other complicated aspects to web design is the rules of design are fluid.  So during the design and building phases, one needs to be aware of the different layers of compatibility with other tools frameworks.  Having a good versioning methodology within the project is a much needed advantage but also various roadmaps layered to the adopted tools and frameworks.  

The main reason why I adopted Hugo, is the underlying ability to be able to write content in simple Markdown. Besides there are other frameworks which use markdown, like  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),   However, the complexity of the website is more than just the content, of which Markdown alone can do well on its own.  So what is the plan and what is needed to take basic Markdown pages to be something more?

The project will need to design brief and this can be presented through basic Markdown.  Any elements or Page assets required to improve the presentation of this Design Brief, should be the priority.  All other fancy elements that are not necessary can be postponed until the Design Brief has declared their necessities.

Next Steps is a Web Design Brief
