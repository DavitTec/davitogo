## Front Page Content

We are building a new Hugo Theme, called ***davitogo***.  
This theme is *work in progress* development and version is 0.0.1
The theme can be accessed and downloaded from Gitbhub repository 
[github.com/DavitTec/davitogo](github.com/DavitTec/davitogo)

You will need to have the latest version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
The plan is to have a theme which supports content on your front page and some basic page structure.
The focus is on style and structure not content. However, we may develop a documents directory about the use of this template under */davitogo*.
