> a new Hugo Theme, called ***davitogo***.  

[toc]

We are building a new Hugo Theme, called ***davitogo*** for our
own use on a hugo static website project (later to be published).

This theme is *work in progress* development and version is [0.0.1](CHANGELOG.md#[0.0.1] )
The theme can be accessed and downloaded from Gitbhub repository 
[github.com/DavitTec/davitogo](github.com/DavitTec/davitogo)

You will need to have the latest version of [Hugo][1] 

The plan is to have a theme which supports content on your front page
and some basic page structure.
The focus is on style and structure not content. However, we may develop
a documents directory about the use of this theme template under */contents/davitogo*.

For more information about this Project and theme, head over to the [About page](about.md)
